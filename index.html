            <h2>The future has arrived.</h2>
            <p>While we can't predict the future, we can inspire it. So what will our cars look like and how will they
                function? Will we drive them or will they drive us? That seems to be the question on everyone's mind.
                Well, we have an idea. Cars are for people who want to go to more places safely and efficiently</p>

                More of a pal. </h2>
            <p>Concept-i follows our belief that vehicles shouldn't start with technology—they should start, and end,
                with the experience of the people who use them. Therefore, Concept-i was built from the inside out, with
                a focus on making it immersive, energetic and, most importantly—approachable. </p>

            <h2>Neue Toyota Concept Cars in Tokio</h2>
            <p>At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Toyota is demo’ing it’s idea of the “Future of
                Mobility”. As has become plainly obvious over the last couple years, Toyota believes plug-in vehicles
                will fail and that fuel cell EV’s are the future. While other companies are at CES showing off battery
                based EV’s, Toyota is sticking with their fuel cells.</p>

            <h2>Concept-i looks as brilliant</h2>
            <p>Its minimal yet artful interior is designed to help support its user experience. Lines flow from the
                center of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui travels around them, using light, sound and
                even touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color
                Head-Up Display that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered. </p>

                <p>In the future, we envision you, Yui and the car working together—like teammates. Now, here comes the
                    really fun part. Thanks to the car's advanced automated driving technologies, people with all levels
                    of
                    ability can enjoy the ride. You're still in charge of the car. However, through biometric sensors
                    throughout the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. That information then gets analyzed by
                    the
                    car's AI. That's when the automated features kick in. </p>
